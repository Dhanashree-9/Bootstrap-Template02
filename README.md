# Bootstrap-Template02


I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully developed a responsive and visually appealing template using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as part of my front-end web development journey.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

✅ Writing clean, semantic HTML
✅ Designing responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and Bootstrap components
✅ Applying consistent styling and layout principles
✅ Focusing on UI/UX fundamentals for a better user experience
